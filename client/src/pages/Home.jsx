      <h1>Welcome Aboard!</h1>
      <h6>Welcome to Adrenaline Sport Fishing Charters.
My name is Captain Pat Crosby and I am obsessed with being on the water. I've had a lifelong passion for fishing and anything to do with boats and being on our Seas. I hold a 200 ton masters license as well as a 1600 ton mates license. Over my Maritime career I've served on wooden square rigged tall ships to cement carriers and 100,000 barrel petroleum carriers. Throughout my career I've always kept a passion for offshore fishing in the beauty of our Great Lakes. I believe this background provides me with the ability to share my experiences and skills to provide you and your family or friends with a truly memorable fishing charter. You're in good hands with Adrenaline Sport Fishing charters.
